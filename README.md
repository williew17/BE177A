Context Based Remote Patient Monitoring Using Google Assistant

There are two implementations in this repository, the Android Wear 2.0 application and the Google Home action.
Both of these implementations use voice activation and input to improve use of PROMIS surveys by geriatric patients.

## Google Home Action
- `functions` All code goes inside this folder
  1. `index.js` Holds the main fulfillment code
  2. `package.json` npm  package file describing code
- `.firebaserc` Hidden file for use by firebase
- `firebase.json` JSON which holds the information about your project
